   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Add background music (optional)**
   ```bash
   # Place your music file in the public directory
   cp your-music-file.mp3 public/background-music.mp3
   ```

5. **Set up database**
   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Run all migration files in `supabase/migrations/` in order
   - Configure Row Level Security policies
   - Set up storage bucket for thumbnails

6. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## üìä Database Schema

### Games Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE games (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title text NOT NULL,
  prompt text NOT NULL,
  code text NOT NULL,
  thumbnail_url text DEFAULT '/placeholder.png',
  status text DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved')),
  vote_score integer DEFAULT 0,
  vote_count integer DEFAULT 0,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Game Votes Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE game_votes (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  game_id uuid REFERENCES games(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  ip_hash text NOT NULL,
  vote integer NOT NULL CHECK (vote IN (-1, 1)),
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE(game_id, ip_hash)
);
```

### Security Policies
- Anonymous users can view approved games and vote
- Service role has full access for automated generation
- IP-based voting prevents duplicate votes while preserving privacy

## üéÆ Game Generation Process

### Stage 1: Concept Creation
The AI is prompted to create focused, playable game concepts:
```
"Create a simple browser mini-game concept with clear objectives, 
simple controls, and immediate engagement factor."
```

### Stage 2: Thumbnail Generation
DALL-E 3 creates pixel art game screenshots:
```
"Pixel art game screenshot of [TITLE]. Retro 8-bit arcade game style, 
bright vibrant colors, game interface visible, action scene."
```

### Stage 3: Code Generation  
Complete playable games are generated with optimized prompts:
```
"Create a complete HTML game with canvas, smooth animations, 
collision detection, scoring system, and proper game loop."
```

### Stage 4: Quality Control
- Games are automatically approved and added to the library
- Community voting system maintains quality standards
- Low-rated games are automatically removed
