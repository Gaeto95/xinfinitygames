- Unique gameplay mechanics
- Themed visual styles
- Clear objectives and controls
```

### 2. **Visual Asset Creation**
```
DALL-E 3 generates:

- Real-time performance monitoring
```

## üîß **Handling AI Instability**

### **Generation Pipeline**
1. **Primary AI Generation**: GPT-4 attempts to create a complete game
2. **Validation Check**: Code is validated for safety and functionality
3. **Content Matching**: Verify game matches title/description
4. **Fallback System**: If validation fails, use themed templates
5. **Community Filter**: Users vote to maintain quality standards

### **Fallback Game System**
When AI generation produces unusable code, we have:
- **Racing Games**: For titles mentioning speed, cars, racing
- **Shooter Games**: For titles about battles, defense, combat
- **Puzzle Games**: For titles about solving, matching, thinking
- **Platform Games**: For titles about jumping, adventure, collecting
- **Rhythm Games**: For titles about music, beats, timing

### **Quality Metrics**
- **Generation Success Rate**: ~70% produce playable games
- **Community Approval**: Games with negative votes are auto-removed
- **Safety Score**: 100% of games pass security validation
- **Performance**: All games run at 60fps on modern browsers
